# decentralized-rating-system

#### This is my attempt at creating the first of many decentralized information hubs/ databases with forum style answers. *(Stack overflow but with an open sourced smart contract)*




My goal is to utilize the internet in a more efficient manner by creating UI/UX that are not only easy to traverse, but also filled with quality content and information so that anyone, anywhere, (with internet access), can learn about anything that interests them in a simplistic way. I would also like these community-driven databases to be as decentralized as possible so that the information that is available to the people, can never be malicously altered or deleted.


All of my projects pertaining to information and data will always be completely non-profit and for the public good. I believe knowledge is power, and that power should be more evenly distributed amongst Earth's population. 


If you would like to help or assist in anyway, that would be greatly appreciated!
